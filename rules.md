# Protocol

<p style='text-align: justify;'> We will consider using and will conduct beta testing of fully fledged platforms such as Codalab or Huawei Cloud Competition for hosting the competition. Alternatively, we may use online forms on the website for registration and submissions. Participants will follow the outlined steps to register for the competition: </p>

* <p style='text-align: justify;'> The participants register on the website by entering their team name, email address, and affiliations using a form. Then, they receive an ID code to identify their submissions. </p>

* <p style='text-align: justify;'> During registration process, the participant is asked to agree to abide by the rules of the competition. </p>

* <p style='text-align: justify;'> The participant can download the starter kit and the dataset from given repository and download links and follow the Tutorial notebook to learn about the dataset format, data readers, evaluation protocol and the details of the baseline models. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Registered participants will need to include the following in their submission:  </p>
  
* <p style='text-align: justify;'> Same ID code given after registration to identify their multiple submissions. </p>

* <p style='text-align: justify;'> A Poetry configuration to manage the participant’s Python library dependencies in a deter-ministic way. We will give a template and tutorial to participants. </p>

* <p style='text-align: justify;'> A brief description of their method will required for the winning submissions. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Please note that the above submission process might slightly change if we can test and successfully adopt of competition platform. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> Tsssso prevent cheating, we will keep the test set confidential before, during and after the competition is finished. We will also review every potentially winning submission to check for cheating. </p>
